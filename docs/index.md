## Summary

This app will receive daily input from a user, where it can then turn it into visually pleasing analytics of one's own life, see a graph of how many times you stuck to your diet throughout the month, the annual percentage of work/school hours you're putting in, or simply what days you been forgetting to brush your teeth.

In addition to this routine feature, it will be able to add a personal stretch "Goal and grade" function, where a user can enter a goal in their routine, and be graded for how well they have done.

For example, A athlete can set a goal to exercise 5 times a week for a year, and every month will receive a letter grade, review, and analytics of their progress and efforts made to that goal.

## Client component
 
### Functionality

The UI is mostly going to consist of a home where you can input your daily data and see your pinned graphs in one place. Also i will add tabs Areas where you can go to see more analytics throughout different timespans. And Somewhere to go where you can open a calender and set goals to be graded for throughout the upcoming years.

### Persistent data

I would hope to keep the app fully functional whilst offline, Retaining all the essential User data and goals functional and locally on the device itself.

### Device/external services

I think the app can include bells and whistles that use online connections like weather data, daily encouraging messages/horoscopes.
## Server component

### Functionality

THe server will handle data processing and handling analytics, as well as provide syncing and managing logins across multiple devices.

### Persistent data

The server should keep a backup of all essential users data as soon as connections become available

### External services

TBD

## Stretch goals/possible enhancements 

Overall I want the project in a complete state, able to record keep and make the promised analytics, The biggest stretch goal is probably the "Goal and Grade" function itself.
