## Summary

This app will receive daily input from a user, where it can then turn it into visually pleasing analytics of one's own life, see a graph of how many times you stuck to your diet throughout the month, the annual percentage of work/school hours you're putting in, or simply what days you been forgetting to brush your teeth.

In addition to this routine feature, it will be able to add a personal stretch "Goal and grade" function, where a user can enter a goal in their routine, and be graded for how well they have done.

For example, A athlete can set a goal to exercise 5 times a week for a year, and every month will receive a letter grade, review, and analytics of their progress and efforts made to that goal.

## Intended users

As a data enthusiast, I love the idea of keeping a record of my own life analytics and want an app that would simplify this curious data.

As an Athlete, I want an app that keeps a sharp grade for my exercise routine and can also set and log alarms into one app seamlessly so that I can track my goals and have a comprehensive understanding of my routine

As a busy worker, I want a record of my work efforts to see where my burnouts lay and where my vacations are best assigned

As someone who loses track of time easily, I want an app that helps me manage my routine and time better so that I can keep focused and avoid unproductivity.

## Client component
 
### Functionality

The UI is mostly going to consist of a home where you can input your daily data and see your pinned graphs. Also, Areas where you can go to see more analytics throughout different timespans. And Somewhere to go where you can set goals to be graded for throughout the upcoming years.

### Persistent data

I would hope to keep the app fully functional whilst offline, Retaining all the essential User data and goals functional and locally on the device itself.

### Device/external services

I would like the app to backup its essential data and goals online.

I think the app can include bells and whistles that use online connections like weather data, daily encouraging messages/horoscopes    
## Server component

### Functionality

The server will mostly be handling syncing and and logins across devices.

### Persistent data

The server should keep a backup of all essential users data as soon as connections become available

### External services

TBD-The server likely will use external services that help to handle data and graphing but I cant think of any immediately

## Stretch goals/possible enhancements 

Overall I want the project in a complete state, able to record keep and make the promised analytics, The biggest stretch goal is probably the "Goal and Grade" function itself.
